# Local overrides for files in this module
# The repository-level .gitignore contains a global `*.svg` rule which ignores
# all SVGs. Allow specific SVG figures used in the thesis to be tracked here.

# Re-include SVGs in the thesis image folder (must come after the global ignore)
!image/*.svg
# Explicitly allow files with non-ASCII names (optional, safe to keep)
!image/セグメントスイープ3.svg
