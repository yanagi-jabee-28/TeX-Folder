# merge_markdown scripts — usage

Quick: two scripts are provided to merge multiple Markdown files into one:

- `scripts/merge_markdown.ps1` — PowerShell (Windows-first, also works on PowerShell Core)
- `scripts/merge_markdown.py` — Cross-platform Python 3 script

Features
- Preserve first-file YAML front-matter, strip subsequent ones
- Optional autogenerated TOC from headings
- Insert provenance (`<!-- source: ... -->`) before each file's content
- Avoid accidental overwrite (use `-Force` / `--force`)

Examples

- PowerShell (recommended on Windows):
  ```powershell
  # merge all formatted references under 資料/
  .\scripts\merge_markdown.ps1 -Glob '資料/*_formatted.md' -Output combined_materials.md -AddTOC -Force
  ```

- Python (cross-platform):
  ```bash
  python scripts/merge_markdown.py -o combined_materials.md --toc --force
  ```

Notes & tips
- Review the resulting file before committing. The script inserts `<!-- source: ... -->` comments to keep provenance.
- If you want a different ordering, pass an explicit ordered list of files to the script.
- The scripts do not alter the source files.

Want me to run the merge now and create `combined_materials.md` from the project's `資料/*_formatted.md` files? Reply with **Yes** to proceed.
